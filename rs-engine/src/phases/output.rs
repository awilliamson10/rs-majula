    /// Processes the output phase of the engine tick cycle.

    /// For each active player, within a panic-catching boundary, encodes
    /// and flushes all outbound data accumulated during the tick:
    ///
    /// 1. Computes coordinate deltas and level-change flags.
    /// 2. Encodes player info (nearby player updates, appearance, movement).
    /// 3. Encodes NPC info (nearby NPC updates, movement, animations).
    /// 4. Sends map rebuild packets if the player changed levels.
    /// 5. Writes player info and NPC info packets.
    /// 6. Sends zone update packets for zones the player observes.
    /// 7. Sends inventory change packets for modified inventories.
    /// 8. Sends stat change packets for modified skills.
    /// 9. Updates AFK zone tracking.
    /// 10. Flushes the player's output buffer to the network channel.
    ///
    /// The player is temporarily `take()`-n from the slot for the duration
    /// of encoding and always restored afterward, even after a panic.
    /// Players that panic are emergency-removed.
    ///
    /// # Side Effects
    ///
    /// * Writes encoded packets to each player's output buffer.
    /// * Flushes output buffers to the network transport.
    /// * May emergency-remove players that cause panics.
