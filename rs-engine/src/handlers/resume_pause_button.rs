/// Handles the `ResumePauseButton` client protocol message.
///
/// Resumes execution of the player's active script that was paused waiting for a
/// generic button press (e.g., "click here to continue" dialogs). Validates that
/// the player has an active script in the `PauseButton` execution state before
/// resuming it.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `active` - The active player whose client sent this message.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(())` on success.
/// * `Err(ScriptError::Client)` if the player has no active script or the script
///   is not in the `PauseButton` state.
///
/// # Side Effects
///
/// * Resumes the paused script execution via `run_script_by_state`.
///
/// # Call Stack
///
/// **Called by:** `ActivePlayer::decode_and_handle` (via `ClientGameHandler` dispatch)
