/// An 8x8 tile region that manages all entities and events within its bounds.
///
/// Each `Zone` tracks the players, NPCs, locs (map objects/scenery), and objs
/// (ground items) occupying its 8x8 tile area. It also maintains a queue of
/// [`ZoneEvent`]s representing state changes that must be communicated to
/// observing clients.
///
/// # Event model
///
/// When entities are added, removed, or modified, the zone queues events that
/// are consumed during the zone output phase of each engine tick. Events are
/// categorized as:
///
/// - **Enclosed** -- broadcast to all players observing the zone.
/// - **Follows** -- sent only to a specific player (e.g., privately visible objs).
///
/// Enclosed events are batched into a shared byte buffer via [`compute_shared`](Self::compute_shared)
/// for efficient delivery.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// Entities with [`EntityLifeTime::Despawn`] are removed from storage when deleted.
/// Entities with [`EntityLifeTime::Respawn`] remain in storage but become invisible
/// until their respawn clock expires.
